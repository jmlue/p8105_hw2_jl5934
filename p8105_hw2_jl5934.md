# Problem 1

\##Importing the Data, cleaning it

Start with the polls data by month and year.

``` r
Pol_Month.df = read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(
    mon,
    c("year", "month", "day")
  ) 
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
Pol_Month.df = Pol_Month.df %>% mutate(month = case_match(
    month,
    "01" ~ "January",
    "02" ~ "February",
    "03" ~ "March",
    "04" ~ "April",
    "05" ~ "May",
    "06" ~ "June",
    "07" ~ "July",
    "08" ~ "August",
    "09" ~ "September",
    "10" ~ "October",
    "11" ~ "November",
    "12" ~ "December"))

Pol_Month.df = Pol_Month.df %>% mutate(President = case_when(
  prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
  prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem"
))
  
Pol_Month.df = select(Pol_Month.df, -c("prez_gop", "prez_dem", "day"))
```

Next do the Snp outcome, again by month and year. Here, the years were
in the format of only the last two digits (as opposed to four digits
like the other datasets). I saw that 00-13 related to 2000-2013, and
50-99 for 1950-1999. So I added a new column to create a prefix that I
then concatenated to make the full four digit variable, and then removed
that prior working column. This was to allow for downstream merging by
year and month.

``` r
Snp.df = read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(
    date,
    c("month", "day", "year")
  )
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
Snp.df = Snp.df %>% mutate(month = case_match(
    month,
    "1" ~ "January",
    "2" ~ "February",
    "3" ~ "March",
    "4" ~ "April",
    "5" ~ "May",
    "6" ~ "June",
    "7" ~ "July",
    "8" ~ "August",
    "9" ~ "September",
    "10" ~ "October",
    "11" ~ "November",
    "12" ~ "December"))

Snp.df = select(Snp.df, c(year, month, everything()))

Snp.df <- Snp.df %>%
  mutate(year_prefix = case_when(
    year < 16 ~ 20,
    year > 49 ~ 19)) %>%
  mutate(year = paste(year_prefix,year, sep = "")) %>%
  select(-c("year_prefix"))
```

Last the unemployment rate by month and year. Here month information was
by three letter abbreviation, so converted that. Additionally, year was
in format of number, other two were character format, so I converted to
allow for downstream merging.

``` r
Unemployment.df = read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_rate"
  )
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
Unemployment.df[["year"]] <- as.character(Unemployment.df[["year"]])

Unemployment.df = Unemployment.df %>% mutate(month = case_match(
    month,
    "jan" ~ "January",
    "feb" ~ "February",
    "mar" ~ "March",
    "apr" ~ "April",
    "may" ~ "May",
    "jun" ~ "June",
    "jul" ~ "July",
    "aug" ~ "August",
    "sep" ~ "September",
    "oct" ~ "October",
    "nov" ~ "November",
    "dec" ~ "December"))
```

## Merging the datasets

First we merge Pol data by month and snapshot based on same column of
year and month. Then we take that new merged dataframe and merge it with
unemployment again by year and month.

``` r
Pol_Snp.df <- full_join(Pol_Month.df, Snp.df, by = c("year", "month"))

Pol_Snp_Unemployment.df <- full_join(Pol_Snp.df, Unemployment.df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

## Describing the dataframes

Variables contained:

- The Pol_Month dataframe included variables for year, month, gov_gop,
  sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, President. The size of
  the dataset is 822 rows by 9 columns. It was describing the breakdown
  of seats in the senate, governorships, and the President based on
  Democrat or Republican status for specific date that was made up of a
  day, month, and year.

  - The range of years represented in this dataset are 1947, 2015.

- The Snp dataframe included variables year, month, day, close. The size
  of the dataset is 787 rows by 4 columns. It was describing the Snp
  close value, based on date that included day, month, and year.

  - The range of years represented in this dataset are 1950, 2015. The
    range of the Snp was 17.049999, 2107.389893, and the mean was
    474.8887404.

- The Unemployment dataframe included variables year, month,
  unemployment_rate. The size of the dataset is 816 rows by 3 columns.
  It was describing the unemployment rate based on date that inclued
  month and year.

  - The range of years represented in this dataset are 1948, 2015. When
    we attempt to caculate the range of the Unemployment rate NA, NA,
    and the mean NA, we get NA, as there are missing values that would
    need to be dealt with.

# Problem 2

## Reading in and cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset

First, we will read in the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet from the xlsx file,
selecing cells with data, ignoring the header icon and the sums at the
bottom. Clean the column names. Then mutate a new variable for homes
powered (based on the fact that each ton of trash equates to on average
500 kilowatts of electricity. An average household will use 30). In this
one year was a character, so it was chnaged to a numeric variable to
allow for downstream merge. A new variable was made to label these
values as belonging to Mr. Trash Wheel, labeled “Mister.

``` r
MrTrashWheel.df <- readxl::read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                   sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                   range = "A2:N549",
                   col_names = TRUE,
                   na = "") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

MrTrashWheel.df <- MrTrashWheel.df %>% mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30)

MrTrashWheel.df <- MrTrashWheel.df %>% mutate(Trash_wheel = "Mister")

MrTrashWheel.df[["year"]] <- as.numeric(MrTrashWheel.df[["year"]])
```

Second, we will read in the Professor Trash Wheel sheet, selecting cells
with data. Again we ignore the header and sums at the bottom. Column
names are cleaned, and a new mutated variable for homes powered was made
as above. A new variable was mutated to identify the source of the data,
as “Professor”.

``` r
ProfTrashWheel.df <- readxl::read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                   sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
                   range = "A2:M96",
                   col_names = TRUE,
                   na = "") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

ProfTrashWheel.df <- ProfTrashWheel.df %>% mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30)

ProfTrashWheel.df <- ProfTrashWheel.df %>% mutate(Trash_wheel = "Professor")
```

Lastly, we will read in the Gwynnda Trash Wheel sheet. We selected cells
with data only, ignoring the header and sums at the bottom. Column names
were cleaned, and a new mutated variable for homes powered was made.
Again a new variable was mutated to identify the source as “Gwynnda”.

``` r
Gwynnda.df <- readxl::read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                   sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
                   range = "A2:K108",
                   col_names = TRUE,
                   na = "") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

Gwynnda.df <- Gwynnda.df %>% mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30)

Gwynnda.df <- Gwynnda.df %>% mutate(Trash_wheel = "Gwynnda")
```

## Combine datasets

To combine datasets and retain all the information we first do full join
with Mister and Professor Trash Wheel. Of note Professor Trash wheel has
missing values for sports balls as it did not have that column to begin
with.

We then take that Mr_Prof set and combine it with Gwynnda, which of note
adds a new variable column for plastic bags, but has missing values for
glass bottles, grocery bags, chip bags, and sports balls as it did not
include that information originally.

``` r
Mr_ProfTrashWheel.df <- full_join(MrTrashWheel.df, ProfTrashWheel.df) 
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
    ## volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
    ## glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, homes_powered, Trash_wheel)`

``` r
All_TrashWheel.df <- full_join(Mr_ProfTrashWheel.df, Gwynnda.df) #maybe month, year and date redundant?
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
    ## volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
    ## homes_powered, Trash_wheel)`

## Describing the combined dataset

- The variables contained in this combined dataset are dumpster, month,
  year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles,
  polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags,
  sports_balls, homes_powered, Trash_wheel, plastic_bags.

- The dimensions are 16 columns by 747 rows.

- The total weight of trash collected by professor Trash wheel was
  190.12 tons.

- The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July 2021
  was 1.63^{4}.

# Problem 3

## Importing, cleaning, tidying up the dataset

``` r
Baseline_demographics.df <- read_csv("data/data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", 
                                     skip = 1,
                                     na = ".") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (6): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4, Age at onset
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
Baseline_demographics.df[["sex"]] <- as.factor(Baseline_demographics.df[["sex"]]) #sex =1 if male, 0 = female, consider renaming
Baseline_demographics.df[["apoe4"]] <- as.factor(Baseline_demographics.df[["apoe4"]])

Baseline_demographics_with_MCI.df <- subset(Baseline_demographics.df, !is.na(age_at_onset))
```

- The number of participants recruited were 483 patients, but of those
  that had MCI it was 97.

- Baseline mean age of all participants was 65.0467909, and for those
  with MCI it was 65.6113402. Range of the ages for all participants was
  56, 72.9 and range of ages for those with MCI was 65.6113402.

- The proportion of women in the study who are APOE4 carriers are
  0.2985782 from the total population, and 0.6521739 amongst those with
  MCI.

We will now import, clean, and rename the variable Study_ID to id to
match the prior above in preparation for merging.

``` r
Amyloid_Biomarker.df <- read_csv("data/data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv",
                                 skip = 1,
                                 na = "NA") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename("id" = "study_id")
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

We will determine which sample IDs are found in Baseline Demographics
but not in amyloid, and then coversely see which are in Amyloid
Biomarkers but not in Baseline Demographics.

``` r
Baseline_demographics.df[["shared_with_biomarkers"]] <- Baseline_demographics.df[["id"]] %in% c(Amyloid_Biomarker.df[["id"]])

Amyloid_Biomarker.df[["shared_with_baseline"]] <- Amyloid_Biomarker.df[["id"]] %in% c(Baseline_demographics.df[["id"]])
```

There are 8 IDs from the baseline demographics not found in the amyloid
biomakers (id = 14, 49, 92, 179, 268, 304, 389, 412).

There are 12 IDs from the amyloid biomarker dataframe not found in the
baseline demographics (id = 484-495).

## Combining the Datasets

``` r
Baseline_Amyloid.df <- inner_join(Baseline_demographics.df, Amyloid_Biomarker.df, by = "id")

write_csv(Baseline_Amyloid.df, "data/data_mci/Baseline_amyloid.csv")
```

When looking at this new combined dataset it takes data based on Sample
ID and now includes both demographic information, as well as clinical
biomarkers, only when sample ID data is available for both.

- The variables included are id, current_age, sex, education, apoe4,
  age_at_onset, shared_with_biomarkers, baseline, time_2, time_4,
  time_6, time_8, shared_with_baseline.

- The size of the dataframe is 475 rows by 13 columns.
